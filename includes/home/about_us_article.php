                                <hr>
                                <p>Our music society strives to promote a high standard of music-making from the many talented musicians across the College but also aims to provide opportunities for students to partake in fun, group activities to take a break from their studies. With an orchestra, chorus, big band and excellent practice facilities, thereâ€™s something for everyone with TARUCMS as students can play,  practice and conduct during their time at the College.</p>
